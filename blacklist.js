/**
 *  I had already published three posts to Medium before making this bot, and
 *  as it isn't currently possible to add a canonical URL to medium posts 
 *  unless they're created using the API. 
 *
 *  Hopefully this will change in the future â€“ or I'll come up with a better
 *  solution. But until then, the array in this file will be used to extend
 *  the medium posts list.
